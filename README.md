iLadder Community Levels

This repository hosts level sets created by the community.  These levels are accessible to the iLadder application.  To contribute your own levels follow the following simple steps.

1. Create your file structure.  For example: Levels/ReallyAwesomeLevels/Level One... Level Two.  Note that all level sets must start under the root Levels folder.
2. Create your level file as a simple text file using the lvl file extension.
3. See [Object Legend](https://github.com/travislondon/iLadder/blob/master/Game/ObjectLegend.md) for adding gaming content, adding items from this legend.
4. Use walls to prevent the wrapping feature in the game (otherwise the character will wrap back to the opposite side).
5. Create a level description file (see the [Classic level configuration](https://github.com/travislondon/iLadder/blob/master/Levels/Classic/Classic.cfg) for details), currently this specifies the order of levels in the game.
6. In the iLevel application go to the Get New Levels page, from there navigate to your created level set and choose Get.
7. Begin enjoying playing your new levels :), and sharing them with the community.

As the application progresses expect more support for level descriptions, including things like marking the "Agent" with a different character.
